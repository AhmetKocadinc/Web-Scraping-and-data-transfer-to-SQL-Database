# Web Scraping and data transfer to SQL Database
Web scraping allows you to automatically collect data from websites. In this guide, we’ll go through the process of scraping data from a real estate website using Python and transferring this data to an SQL database. This process is commonly encountered in data analysis and data science projects. Let’s dive into this step-by-step.

### Required Libraries
- **📜 BeautifulSoup:** Used to parse web pages and process HTML content.
- **🌐 Requests:** Used to send HTTP requests to web pages.
- **🧾 Pandas:** Used for processing and analyzing data. It's ideal for handling data frames.
- **🗄️ Sqlalchemy and Psycopg2:** Used to connect to SQL databases like PostgreSQL and write data to them.
- **🔠 re:** Used for text processing with regular expressions. Ideal for formatting data.

### Scraping Data from Web Pages 🕵️‍♂️
The process of scraping data typically involves several steps. First, we need to construct the URLs for the pages we want to scrape. Then, we fetch data from these URLs. 

### Processing the Data ⚙️
After scraping the data, we need to process and clean it to make it suitable for transfer to an SQL database.

### Transferring to SQL Database 💾
Once the data is ready, we need to transfer it to an SQL database. In this example, we will use PostgreSQL.
